                My name is Ricardo Fernandez, but I go by Ricky. I was born in Miami, Florida, but grew up in
                Hawaii on the island of Oahu for most of my life. I graduated with a bachelors degree in finance,
                and have worked for various investment companies as an analyst. I enjoy researching and
                analyzing investment opportunities, as well as trading financial markets. Most recently,
                I have found a passion for programming as it channels my creativity and problem solving
                abilities. On my own, I have been learning Python and SQL, and I have built a few applications 
                at work to assist with my day-to-day tasks. I find myself working in both languages on a daily 
                basis, and the more I learn, the more I enjoy programming.</p>

            <p>Some of my hobbies include playing guitar and piano, shooting billiards, and exercising. My
                favorite sport is boxing. I try to watch every boxing event I can throughout the year. Come football season, I'm a 
                diehard Miami Dolphins and Miami Hurricanes fan.
